        <p>
            As of June 2, 2015 in Italy the "Cookie Law" comes into legal force: it is a law that protects the privacy
            of users on the web which regulates the use of cookies, pieces of text information that a page could save
            temporarily or permanently in the device user during the browsing session.
        </p>

        <p>
            The main purpose of cookies is to enable certain features of a site (so-called “technical cookies”),
             to monitor and/or to profile users while browsing, study their movements and habits of consultation
             with the Web or consumption (so-called “profiling cookie”)
        </p>

        <p>
            On your first access this site will show a notice, asking you to accept
            the consent to eventually use profiling cookies and/or third parties cookies. If you give the consent,
            a technical cookie, from the first-part domain will keep track of your choice for a period not
            exceeding 365 days from the moment of your consent.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Only after the consent</strong>, this site can register third-party cookies in order to ensure the
            functionality of social shares (if provided). For any technical information about their purpose /
            duration and to exercise any OPT-OUT right, see the page of the official policy of the respective platforms:
